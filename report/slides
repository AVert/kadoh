# TITLE

# What have been done so far in the DHT landscape ?

## Theoretical researches

  -> university research : Chord, Kademlia
  -> strong theoretical base
  -> improvement proposals

## Practical large scale implementations

  -> largely used implementations designed for FILE-SHARING
  -> university papers talk about aMule, Bittorrent's Mainline...because they are the only big DHTs

# What is missing ?

## Mobile environments

  -> never taken into account
  -> huge and promising audience

## Web Apps

  -> beyond file-sharing ?

# What have we done ?
